# Example usage

# Create an instance of the Solution class
solution = Solution()

# Example input: list of citizen details
# Assume each detail string has at least 13 characters and the age is always in positions 11 and 12
details = ["7868190130M7522","5303914400F9211","9273338290F4010"]

# Call the countSeniors method and print the result
result = solution.countSeniors(details)
print(result)  # Expected output: 2 (75 and 92 are both greater than 60)
